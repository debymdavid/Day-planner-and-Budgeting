The purpose of this project is to help plan your schedule during your visit to
Dubai. We will suggest tourist spots and places to visit, based on your preferred
area, also considering various factors like the rush hours, and your set budget.
We will track all your completed and pending tasks. Furthermore, we will also
manage and keep a record of your budget and expenditure, which can be
changed and updated at any time. We will save all this information, which will
be kept secure and encrypted in an account, with your username and password.
